## Getting Started on Documentation

All the files(.rst) and folders (images, downloads) related to documentation are created with as much detail as required in the `docs/source` folder.

#### Installation
First we must make sure we have Sphinx related packages installed in your conda environment,
```
 $ (sudo) conda install sphinx
 $ (sudo) conda install sphinx_rtd_theme
```

#### Documentation Setup

Below are the steps how the ``docs`` folder and sphinx are set up is shown here.

1. We begin by creating a Sphinx documentation root directory:

    ```
    (conda_env)youruser@yourpc:~yourWorkspacePath/<project_name> mkdir docs
    (conda_env)youruser@yourpc:~yourWorkspacePath/<project_name> cd docs
    (conda_env)youruser@yourpc:~yourWorkspacePath/<project_name>/docs$
    ```

2. While you run `sphinx-quickstart`, you will be presented with series of questions, the answer to which can depend from project to project, but a generally safe answer set is presented below:

    ```
        Welcome to the Sphinx 1.7.1 quickstart utility.

        Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
        accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

        Selected root path: .

        You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
        Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root path, or you separate
        "source" and "build" directories within the root path.
        > Separate source and build directories (y/n) [n]: y

        Inside the root directory, two more directories will be created; "_templates"
        for custom HTML templates and "_static" for custom stylesheets and other static files. You can enter another prefix (such as ".") to replace the underscore.
        > Name prefix for templates and static dir [_]: (ENTER)

        The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
        > Project name: Getting started with Python Basics
        > Author name(s): Tiger Analytics
        > Project release []: 0.0.1

        If the documents are to be written in a language other than English,
        you can select a language here by its language code. Sphinx will then
        translate text that it generates into that language.

        For a list of supported codes, see
        http://sphinx-doc.org/config.html#confval-language.
        > Project language [en]: (ENTER)

        The file name suffix for source files. Commonly, this is either ".txt"
        or ".rst".  Only files with this suffix are considered documents.
        > Source file suffix [.rst]: (ENTER)

        One document is special in that it is considered the top node of the
        "contents tree", that is, it is the root of the hierarchical structure
        of the documents. Normally, this is "index", but if your "index"
        document is a custom template, you can also set this to another filename.
        > Name of your master document (without suffix) [index]: (ENTER)

        Sphinx can also add configuration for epub output:
        > Do you want to use the epub builder (y/n) [n]: (ENTER)
        Indicate which of the following Sphinx extensions should be enabled:
        > autodoc: automatically insert docstrings from modules (y/n) [n]: y
        > doctest: automatically test code snippets in doctest blocks (y/n) [n]: (ENTER)
        > intersphinx: link between Sphinx documentation of different projects (y/n) [n]: (ENTER)
        > todo: write "todo" entries that can be shown or hidden on build (y/n) [n]:
        > coverage: checks for documentation coverage (y/n) [n]: (ENTER)
        > imgmath: include math, rendered as PNG or SVG images (y/n) [n]: (ENTER)
        > mathjax: include math, rendered in the browser by MathJax (y/n) [n]: (ENTER)
        > ifconfig: conditional inclusion of content based on config values (y/n) [n]: (ENTER)
        > viewcode: include links to the source code of documented Python objects (y/n) [n]: y
        > githubpages: create .nojekyll file to publish the document on GitHub pages (y/n) [n]: (ENTER)

        A Makefile and a Windows command file can be generated for you so that you
        only have to run e.g. `make html' instead of invoking sphinx-build
        directly.
        > Create Makefile? (y/n) [y]: (ENTER)
        > Create Windows command file? (y/n) [y]: (ENTER)

        Creating file ./source/conf.py.
        Creating file ./source/index.rst.
        Creating file ./Makefile.
        Creating file ./make.bat.
    ```

3. Now we can see that some folders and files have been autogenerated for us:

    ```
    (conda_env)youruser@yourpc:~yourWorkspacePath/<project_name>/docs$ ls
    build  make.bat  Makefile  source
    (conda_env)youruser@yourpc:~yourWorkspacePath/<project_name>/docs$ cd source
    (conda_env)youruser@yourpc:~yourWorkspacePath/<project_name>/docs$ ls
    conf.py  index.rst  _static  _templates
    ```

### Sphinx Configuration

While this is also already setup in the example file, you can still go through this to understand how the configuration is done.

1. Previously, we saw that `conf.py` is the configuration file that Sphinx calls whenever a make command is called. Now it’s time we made some configuration changes. Let’s locate and edit the conf.py file:

    ```
    (conda_env)youruser@yourpc:~yourWorkspacePath/<project_name>/docs$ cd source
    (conda_env)youruser@yourpc:~yourWorkspacePath/<project_name>/docse$ vim conf.py
    ```
There are two things we need to tweak, while we have ``conf.py`` open, before we proceed to build our documentation.

##### Theme Configuration

`html_theme = 'sphinx_rtd_theme'`
- There exist numerous other nice themes out there, so if you’re not particularly interested in publishing to RTD then you can choose (or even create) any theme that suits your needs. We chose `sphinx_rtd_theme` since we do want to publish to RTD, plus it is generally quite a nice and clear theme to read.

##### Autodoc Configuration

- Continuing, if we want Sphinx to autogenerate documentation from the comments of our code using the autodoc extension, we have to point Sphinx to the directory in which our Python source codes reside. This can be done by uncommenting and altering the following lines, which are generally found at the top of the file:

    ```
    import os
    import sys
    sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath("../../src/pack_install"))
    ```

### Building our Documentation
- In general, when we want to build our (html) documentation, we do so by calling the following commands in our *Documentation* root directory:

    ```
    (conda_env)youruser@yourpc:~yourWorkspacePath/<project_name>/docs$ sphinx-build -b html source build
    (conda_env)youruser@yourpc:~yourWorkspacePath/<project_name>/docs$ make html (or) make clean html
    ```
### Generating documentation from docstrings

- Now let’s see how we can auto-generate documentation from the docstrings in our Python source files. The sphinx-apidoc command can be used to auto-generate some .rst files for our Python module. This can be done as follows:

    ```
    (conda_env)youruser@yourpc:~yourWorkspacePath/<project_name>/docs$ sphinx-apidoc -o ./source ../basics
    Creating file ./source/area.rst.
    Creating file ./source/main.rst.
    Creating file ./source/modules.rst.
    ```
Adding `modules.rst` to toctree index will render the  API Documentation as well while you build it.

### Launching the UI
- Run the folloing command to launch a local UI server.

    ```
    (conda_env)youruser@yourpc:~yourWorkspacePath/<project_name>/docs/build$ python -m http.server {port}
    ```
